# vestaria-saga-trainer

This is a simple cheat for vestarua saga game that minimizes the difficulty of the game while keeping it fun, after all the game is too difficult.

Its features are
- Modify the amount of money
- Modify the attributes of each character to the upper limit (turns green)
- Modify the EXP of each character (you will be upgraded every time you get EXP, no matter how much you get)

## Compile

Use Visual Studio, and use vcpkg for package management.

The project only uses a simple wrapper for the WIN32 API I wrote before (header file library only), so if you don't want to use vcpkg, you can just copy my [my-windows](https://github.com/Chaojimengnan/my-windows) header file over and compile it directly.
